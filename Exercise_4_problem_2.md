## Problem 2 - Temperature classifier (*3 points*)

In Problem 2 of Exercise 3 last week, we practiced how to classify temperatures into four different classes (*i.e., cold, slippery, comfortable, and warm*). Let's continue working with the same idea. 

Here, you should create a function called `temp_classifier` that accepts a temperature value in Celsius that will be reclassified into integer numbers 0-3 based on following criteria:

| Return value | Classification criteria                                                  |
| :----------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0            | Temperatures below -2 degrees Celsius                                    |
| 1            | Temperatures equal or warmer than -2, but less than +2 degrees Celsius   |
| 2            | Temperatures equal or warmer than +2, but less than +15 degrees Celsius  |
| 3            | Temperatures equal or warmer than +15 degrees Celsius                    |

**Notice**: Closely follow the instructions! 

**Your score on this problem will be based on following criteria:**

- Creating a new function called `temp_classifier` **(0.5 points)**
- Defining one parameter called `temp_celsius` in your `temp_classifier` function **(0.3 points)**
- Reclassifying input temperatures based on the criteria in the above table and returning the reclassified value as an integer number (i.e., 0, 1, 2, or 3) **(1.2 points)**
- Adding comments in your code and a docstring that explains how to use your `temp_classifier` function (i.e., you should write the purpose of the function, parameters, and returned values) **(1.0 points)**

```python
# YOUR CODE HERE to define temp_classifier
```

**Use** your newly created function to print the answers to the following questions:


```python
# 1. What is the class value for 16.5 degrees Celsius?
# YOUR CODE HERE
#
# 2. What is the class value for +2 degrees Celsius?
# YOUR CODE HERE
#

```

### Problem 2 tests

Check that the function produces correct answers for selected values:

```python
# 1. What is the class value for 16.5 degrees (Celsius)?
assert temp_classifier(16.5) == 3, 'Wrong class'
print("ok :)")
```


```python
# 2. What is the class value for +2 degrees (Celsius)?
assert temp_classifier(2) == 2, 'Wrong class'
print("ok :)")
```


```python
# 3. What is the class value for +1 degrees (Celsius)?
assert temp_classifier(1) == 1, 'Wrong class'
print("ok :)")
```


```python
# 4. What is the class value for -5 degrees (Celsius)?
assert temp_classifier(-5) == 0, 'Wrong class'
print("ok :)")
```

### Check your code

 - Are all the variable names are correct?
 - Does your code has enough comments?
 - Does your function has an informative dosctring?
