## Problem 1 - Simple temperature calculator (*3 points*)

In the first problem your aim is to create a function that converts the input temperature from degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius. The conversion formula from Fahrenheit to Celsius can be found below.

  T_{Celsius} = ( T_{Fahrenheit} - 32 ) / 1.8

If everything in your script is working properly the following test case should work:

  ```python
  >>> print("32 degrees Fahrenheit in Celsius is:", fahr_to_celsius(32))
  32 degrees Fahrenheit in Celsius is: 0.0
  ```

**Notice**: Closely follow the instructions! For example, you should be sure to use **exactly** the same variable, function, and parameter names as stated in the instructions. 

**Your score on this problem will be based on following criteria:**

- Creating a function called `fahr_to_celsius`
- Defining the function to have one input parameter called `temp_fahrenheit`
- Creating a variable called `converted_temp` inside the function to which you should assign the conversion result (i.e., the input Fahrenheit temperature converted to Celsius)
- Returning the converted value from the function back to the user
- Answering some questions about functions at the end of this problem
- Adding comments in your code and a docstring that explains how to use your `fahr_to_celsius` function (i.e., you should write the purpose of the function, parameters, and returned values)


```python
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

### Problem 1 tests

```python
# Check that the function produces correct answers for:
# 1. What is 48° Fahrenheit in Celsius? 
# 2. What about 71° Fahrenheit in Celsius?
```

### Check your code

- Make sure you used the given variable names
- Check that you have added necessary comments to your code
- Check that your function has a docstring that describes what it does

### Questions

We would like you to think about and answer the following questions based on the materials and ideas that you learned during the lecture:

  1. Is the concept of function clear to you? If not, what do you not understand?
  2. What are some of the benefits of using functions?
  
Write your answers below.
